    <p>Artistic swimming (known as synchronised swimming until 2017) has been an event at the Summer Olympics since the 1984 Games. The current Olympic program has competition in duet and team events, but in past games, there was also a solo event. The United States, Canada and Japan have traditionally been the strongest nations in the sport, winning the Olympic medals from 1984 through 1996, but Russia has recently dominated, winning every event between 2000 and 2016.</p>
