      Sailing (also known as yachting until 2000) has been one of the Olympic sports since the Games of the I Olympiad, held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. Despite being scheduled in the first Olympic program, the races were canceled due to severe weather conditions. Apart from the 1904 Summer Olympics, sailing has been present in every edition of the Olympic Games.
      The number of sailors competing has been reduced from 380 to 350, with an equal numbers of male and female athletes for the first time ever.

The qualification period commenced at the 2018 Sailing World Championships in Aarhus, Denmark. There, 101 places, about forty percent of the total quota, will be awarded to the highest finishing nations. Six places will be available in the men's Laser and women's Laser Radial classes at the 2018 Asian Games and 2019 Pan American Games, whereas sixty-one more will be distributed to the sailors at the World Championships for all boats in 2019. Continental qualification regattas were held to decide the remainder of the total quota, while two spots each in the one-person dinghy classes were granted to eligible NOCs through the Tripartite Commission Invitation.
As hosts, Japan has been guaranteed one quota place in each of the ten classes.
